        <h2>A Human Wizard ðŸ”®</h2>
        <p class="gale-bio">
          Gale Dekarios is a wizard who lives in Waterdeep. n his youth, Gale
          was a prodigiously talented practitioner of the Art. He likened his
          skill as a wizard to that of an actual artist, who manipulated the
          Weave in the same manner a virtuoso did music. Gale studied as an
          apprentice in Blackstaff Academy. He was already confident about his
          arcane skills and decided to use the Blackstaff to open a portal to
          his dorm. However, the portal he opened led not to his dorm but to
          Limbo with an annoyed slaad standing right in front of the portal.
          Fortunately, the then Blackstaff managed to intervene and seal the
          portal in time.[1] After becoming a chosen and spending time with
          Mystra, Gale sought more recognition from her and wished her to reveal
          more arcane secrets to him so he could serve her better. However, his
          request was declined by the goddess, and Mystra only smiled and told
          him to be contented. To prove himself worthy, he sought out an ancient
          "tome of gateways" that contained within it a portion of the Astral
          Plane, described as a "fragment of primal Weave locked out of time"
          that had been separated from the former goddess of magic. He wanted to
          reunite Mystra with her missing piece of magic, but failed in his
          endeavor.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a result of his failed labor of love, Gale's body became the host
          to a Netherese destruction orb. The orb would continuously beat,
          absorbing energy from the Weave, counting down to an ultimate
          destruction that was capable of tearing down cities. Unknown to him,
          the orb did indeed contain a piece of ancient Weaveâ€”but it was the
          Weave of Karsus, which still sought to supplant the original Weave as
          its maker once intended. The orb could only be stabilized by allowing
          it to break down parts of the Weave around it, and as it began by
          draining Gale's own connection to the Weave he found his magical
          abilities greatly weakened. After his folly, Gale isolated himself in
          his tower for a year. His tressym Tara figured out the solution of
          absorbing the Weave from magic items and went looking for suitable
          items for the depressed wizard.
          <br />
          <br />

          In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Gale was taken prisoner
          by illithids upon a nautiloid. A mind flayer tadpole was inserted into
          him through his eye, an act that would normally begin the process of
          ceremorphosis. However, the spelljammer was taken down by a host of
          devils and crashed into the Sword Coast, on the northern bank of the
          River Chionthar. Rather than become a mind flayer himself, Gale was
          granted limited psychic powers, akin to those others referred to as
          True Souls of the Absolute. He soon met up with another passenger of
          the ship, who shared his mysterious new power.
